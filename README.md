# dom-ninja

Vanilla JS library intended to speed up and simplify DOM manipulation.
This library is built entirely in modern, browser compliant vanilla JS, thus should not be seen as an Addition of features, but rather a way to keep the syntax short, direct and self-explanatory, reducing the amount of code needed to achieve certain things and impring code readability.
